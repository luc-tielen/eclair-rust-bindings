# eclair_bindings

High level Rust bindings for interoperability with
[Eclair Datalog](https://github.com/luc-tielen/eclair-lang.git).

The library provides an idiomatic Rust interface around the low level
Eclair API.

NOTE: It is highly recommended to use this library together with
`eclair_bindings_derive`, which provides a proc macro that generates the
bindings boilerplate for you (highly recommended).
